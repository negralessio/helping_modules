# About this repository 🎨
This repository contains custom defined modules that have been very useful for me during my studies.
For example the bokeh scatterplot: that allows hovering over the data. This can be useful to quickly identify
cluster of text data after vectorization and clustering.
```
Note that bokeh uses JavaScript and GitHub does not preview it. 
Therefore, some plots are not visible in the notebooks.

### Example: Bokeh Scatterplot
+ Often used in the NLP setting, to allow hovering over vectorized tokens / words
+ Can also be used for simple position reading
