# About this repository ðŸŽ¨
This repository contains custom defined modules that have been very useful for me during my studies.
For example the bokeh scatterplot: that allows hovering over the data. This can be useful to quickly identify
cluster of text data after vectorization and clustering.
```
Note that bokeh uses JavaScript and GitHub does not preview it. 
Therefore, some plots are not visible in the notebooks while on GitHub.

### Example: Bokeh Scatterplot
+ Often used in the NLP setting, to allow hovering over vectorized tokens / words
+ Arbitrary text and column(s) of the input matrix X can be used for tooltips
+ Can also be used for simple position reading
